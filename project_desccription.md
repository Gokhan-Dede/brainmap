Objective

The main objective of this project is to create an AI-based tool able to determine with accuracy whether a patient may have a brain tumor in early stages of development.

Brain tumors are very difficult to detect when in early stage, and often require the attention of highly trained specialists to properly diagnose. For large demographics, it may be difficult to access this type of expertise in a timely manner.
Structure

With the business case in mind, we set out to:

1-	(Data) collect a large dataset of MRI scans with various degrees of brain tumor development, as well as  healthy brain. This should contain all possible information AI may need to learn to detect tumors. These images may need some degree of processing to make them intelligible by an algorithm
2-	(Modeling) Select, assemble and train the correct statistical model for the type of task at hand: classification. This model will form the basis of the AI tool
3-	(Diagnosis) Correctly issue a recommendation for a given, unseen, MRI scan. Is there a risk, estimated with reliable certainty, that the patient may have a malignant form of brain tumor in early stages of development, therefore needing the attention of a specialist?
4-	(Production, Optional) If the main objective is achieved, the project would move on to the creation of a web-based AI tool which would incorporate the results of the model into an easily-digestible format. For this purpose, a chat-based framework has been selected, which would incorporate natural language processing (NLP) in the structure of the project.

Structure

1-	Collectively or individually build a basic model trained locally (2 days)
2-	Select the best performing model and review it collectively (1 day)
3-	Start the production phase of the model while the model gets further improved (2 days). The model will then replace the basic one
